package mocks

/*
Package mocks provide a shared package to be used for mocking microservice interface layers.
The unit tests of the controller/service leverage these mock.
The interface mocking uses testify mock package.
The behaviour could be replicated through the standard library.
We could eventually automatically generate the mocked implementations through mockery package.
